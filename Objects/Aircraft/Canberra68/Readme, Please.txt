Canberra B(I).68

Refurbished B(I).8 bomber sold to Fuerza Aérea del Perú (FAP).
Peruvian Air Force (FAP) Canberras flew combat sorties against Ecuadorian positions during the Cenepa War in 1995.
On 6 February 1995, a Canberra Mk 68 disappeared over the operations zone;
the aircraft had apparently struck a hill in poor weather conditions. Peru retired its Canberras in June 2008

WHAT'S IN:

- a new plane, 4 skins, decals
- screens, pilot, weapons etc

CREDITS:

- Bobrock: plane
- Soulfreak: templates & tweakings
- Paulopanz: skins, decals, screens

NOTES:

- the first 3 skins are about FAP Canberra B(I).8 as Canberra B(I).68 were refurbished in 1974
  I add them to the pack so You have a whole FAP line up. When B(I).8 will be ready You could
  use them as skins and edit data and userilist inis if you like.
- this little job is dedicated to a friend of mine who collects all Peru planes
- maybe someone else could use to build up the Cenepa war against Ecuador....

INSTALL

- all in your mod folder

Enjoy
