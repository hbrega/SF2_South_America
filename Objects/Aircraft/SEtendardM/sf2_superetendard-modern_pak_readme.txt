Dassault Super Etendard (Modernized) Pak (by FoxMonter)                           10/6/2011

For SF2, Any & All (Full-4 Merged Prefered) 

*Note: At minimum, you =MUST= have SF2V for the A-7E cockpit used herein*

This is a complete aircraft package.
It is a major upgrade to the aircraft, with a new 95% SF2 compliant FM, adjusted weapons loadouts, new cockpit & avionics (albeit a stock one repurposed), skins, decals . This is a complete aircraft package. Operation service years have been adjusted to fit, as this model replaces the 'older' Super Etendard for 1991 and later. Weapons are =NOT= inclduded; they are in the Super Etendard pak previously released.

The aircraft comes with 2 skins:

Lo-Viz Gray by me
2-Tone Gray camo by Migfly (found at C6's old site)

As expected, the canopy operates with the Shift/0 key. Wingfold is operated via Shift/9. Decal randomization is set to TRUE.

As always, fairly easy to follow, detailed install instructions are included. So, please read them!! As expected, the usual "Notes and Ramblings" section might make for interestering reading.
And before anybody gripes and whines, YES--I DO know that the SEM's cockpit really dosen't look like that Corsair IIs. We use what we have, to get as close as possible to what's wanted for both accuracy and playability. In the end, Playability wins out. It =IS= still a game, after all.

Happy Landings!

------------------------------------------------

=TO INSTALL:

As I always reccomend, unzip the "sf2_supertetendard-modern_pak.zip" to a temp folder or your desktop or somewhere else that's easy to find

Then, simply, copy/paste the Objects folder supplied directly =OVER= your existing folders. The things will find their way to where they're supposed to be....
 
You'll WILL be asked "OVERWRITE?", just say Yes 

I've already seperated out the various folders , so they'll drop right where they're supposed to be. Cause it just SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much fraking easier this way, ain't it?

----------------------------
Notes:
The RWR list for the TEWS used herein is from the pak by dtmdragon, and lists all sorts of interesting threats. It'd be a good idea to have his pak installed.

I am NOT particularly happy with being forced to use the A-7E pit for this aircraft. In particular, I don't really want the moving map display, and really really didn't want to fiddle with the cockpit ini to try and remove it. BUT ... it does have a lot of the other features I wanted -that what little I'd been able to find in researching-, the HUD, RWR, radars and such.

It should be noted that I've given the radar far greater capabilities than it should have. The Avionics Gurus are welcomed!!! welcomed I say!! to make any and all necessary adjustments to make it a bit more realistic

As always, even for historically correct fanatics like myself, Playbility sometimes has to win. And, as we always say -- if you don't like it, delete it and build your own. But don't piss and moan and bitch and gripe about things we do, with WHAT we have.
