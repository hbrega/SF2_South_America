Aermacchi MB-339A Reduxe 

I always liked this little bird and so I updated it a bit.


 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

Installation:

1st you have to delete the MB-339A folders from your Aircraft & Decals mod folders (only if you have an earlier version installed). 

Simply copy all the files in the respective directory of your game folder.

"User"\Saved Games\ThirdWire\StrikeFighters2

If asked, let overwrite
