Lockheed F-80C Shooting Star Export Workshop

In the '50 several south american countries entered in jet age with the Shooting Star
This huge skinpack portaits these airforces:

- Brazil 	(33 delivered starting in 1958, withdrawn from service in 1973)
- Chile 	(30 delivered from 1958 on, last ones retired from service in 1974)
- Colombia 	(16 delivered starting in 1958, retired by 1966)
- Ecuador 	(16 delivered between 1957 and 1960, six returned to the United States in 1965)
- Peru 		(16 delivered starting in 1958, the type was phased out in 1973)
- Uruguay 	(17 delivered, withdrawn from use in 1971)

Why this little, quite heavy (see the FACh camo skin ...) effort?
Because this is a fantastic, maybe underated, model made by great 3D master Erikgen and these exotic skins are pretty. Aren't they?
