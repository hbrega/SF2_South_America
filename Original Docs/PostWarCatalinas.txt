With the end of the war, all of the flying boat versions of the Catalina were quickly retired from the U.S. Navy, but the amphibious versions remained in service for some years The Catalina subsequently equipped the world's smaller armed services into the late 1960s in fairly substantial numbers.
Even if it left service quite soon, this plane was used worldwide and so useful for many our scenery and campaign.
