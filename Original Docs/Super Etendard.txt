Dassault Super Etendard & Super Etendard(M), SF2 Combo Pak (by FoxMonter)                   

10/6/2011

For SF2, Any & All (Full-4 Merged Prefered - At Minimum, =MUST= have SF2:I AND SF2:V) 

*Note: the reason for these requirements are the cockpits used on =BOTH= versions of the aircraft. They reference 2 very different cockpits and avionics displays, only truely available in a Full-4 Merged installs.*

*Note x2: There are 2 seperate readmes in this Combo Pak - one each for the Super Etendard and Super Etendard (Modernized). It's suggested that after downloading this pak, you unzip to a temp folder or your desktop, and =READ= both before installing, as well as this complete readme. Install instruction are, as usual, the same*

This package contains 2 complete aircaft - the early version, Super Etendard as used by the French Navy and Argentinian Navy,  and the late 90s to-date version, the Super Etendard (Modernized) as used only by the French Navy. All skins, inis, decal, weapons, etc are included. Specific details for each are in their own readmes, inside this archive. You'd do well to read BOTH!!! (no kidding! really!!) All new SF2-style hangar & loading screens are included (exceptng the SuE loading, it's the orignal converted to jpg).

As always, fairly easy to follow, detailed install instructions are included. So, please read them!! I'd reccomend that you unzip this archive FIRST (to a temp folder or your desktop), and READ through this readme document, and the other 2, before installing.
The extensive "Notes" section in each readme also contains a Change List of modifications and other impertinant information. All original readmes are included, for historical reference.

Happy Hunting!

------------------------------------------------

=TO INSTALL:

As I always reccomend, unzip the "sf2_superetendard_combo_pak.zip" to a temp folder or your desktop or somewhere else that's easy to find

Then, simply, copy/paste the Objects folder supplied directly =OVER= your existing folders. The things will find their way to where they're supposed to be....
 
You'll WILL be asked "OVERWRITE?", just say YES 

I've already seperated out the various folders , so they'll drop right where they're supposed to be. Cause it just SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much fraking easier this way, ain't it?

---------
Adding Squadron Listings to the SquadronList.ini:

Extract, if you haven't already, the SquadronList.ini from the MissionData001.cat. Place it in the /PilotData folder.

Then, copy/paste the info below at the end, where *** is the next number in sequence:


[Squadron***]
Name=14Flot
DisplayName=14 Flottille
Nation=FRENCHNAVY

[Squadron***]
Name=11Flot
DisplayName=11 Flottille
Nation=FRENCHNAVY

[Squadron***]
Name=2ARA
DisplayName=2da Escuadrilla Aeronaval de Caza y Ataque 
Nation=ArgentineNavy


I've used a small "decal cheat" to force the Game Engine (tm) to see a Level 1 decal, and turn on the Squadron name window in the Loadout Screen.

Notes:
See each of the seperate readmes for specific notes.

Any and all mistakes, as always, are mine.
