You will get the following skins in this package :

- Original Argentina (2 of them) - Comes from the original pack

* Note : I did not touched the model, all files comes from the original pack. All i did was to tweak some files to get them work properly in SF2 and change path in the ini's. So all credits goes to the persons above.
