Saab JAS 39 Gripen Força Aérea Brasileira Package
by The Scandinavian Front Team

The Saab JAS 39 Gripen (griffin) is a lightweight single-engine multirole fighter manufactured by the Swedish aerospace 
company Saab. It was designed to replace the Saab 35 Draken and 37 Viggen in the Swedish Air Force (Flygvapnet). 
The Gripen has a delta wing and canard configuration with relaxed stability design and fly-by-wire technology. 
It is powered by the Volvo-Flygmotor RM12 engine, a derivative of the General Electric F404, and has a top speed of
Mach 2. Later aircraft are equipped for in-flight refuelling; most of the export aircraft have been designed 
to be compatible with NATO interoperability standards. The Aircraft was most recently leased by Brazil awaiting delivery
of their Gripen-NG; At least 6 Aircraft will be avalible for the 2016 Olympics - most probably many more. 

This package contains two "Proable-in-near-future" Aircraft with correct serials, year-specific loadouts and correct weapons.

JAS 39C-B(razil): The NATO-compatible version of Gripen with extended capabilities in terms of armament, electronics, etc. It uses large colour displays with English language, 
feet and knots instead of meters and km/h. This variant can also be refuelled in flight. 

JAS 39D-B(razil): The two-seat version of the C variant; otherwise similar to the B variant. Training variant.
