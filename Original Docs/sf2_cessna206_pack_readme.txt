SF2 Cessna 206H Pack by Wingzero      2/29/2020

-For SF2, Any and All (Full 4/5 Merged Reccomended, plus Exp 1)

This is a full revamp, for SF2, of the SF/Wo* Cessna 206H "Stationair" by wingzero, originally released in 2010.

This mod includes 2 skins:

No.7 Squadron, Uruguaian Air Force (FAU) -start date 1998

USAF - this is a "What If..." skin, painted to match the T-41s used for USAF training and liason.

All, if not most, markings are decals. Decal randomization is TRUE. As a new 'homegrouwn' templage had to be created, it's included for skinners wishing to create any other users, or other types of skins. A userlist and loadout ini have been built. Please see the "Notes" section for more details.

In-game, on the Aircraft selection drop-down menu, you'll find it as:

U-206H Stationair

As always, fairly easy to follow, yet detailed install instructions are included. So, please read them. One mnight also peruse the "Notes" section for things that might be interesting. The original release had NO readme, but I used the text from the SF1 announcement thread. It's included within the main aircraft's folder.

Happy Landings!

To Install:

As always reccomended, unzip the "sf2_cessna206_pack" to a temp folder or your desktop or somewhere that's easy to find.

Copy/Paste the /Objects folder DIRECTLY into the SF2 game install of choice's /Objects folder. It's already divided into the /Aircraft, /Pilots and /Decals sub-folders. 

Copy/Paste the supplied /Sounds folder DIRECTLY over you existing /Sounds folder. As you may have these sounds already, you'll asked to "Overwrite?" , just say yes. It'll change/hurt nothing.

That should cover it, go fly!

-------------------------------

= NOTES:

-changes:

all hit boxes corrected, adjusted and remade
New more SF2 Compliant FM (although, could use some fine tuning)
new engine sound
new pliot figures
fuel tankage adjusted
new destroyed model (stock 3W Mustang)
Damage textures 

-things unable to change:

lack of smoothing on left lower side of cowling. 3D wise, the aircraft has a number of flaws, but most are "liveable with". Military version did NOT have the whell spats, but as the landing gears are all cast as one piece, they're not removeable via the remove component trick.

----

The real C-206's starting production in 1964, but not many military users until the 1970s. With the included template, you're all welcome to "have at it". 

The destroyed model calls for the Exp1 destroyed Mustang; if you don't have it, you'll have to find something of similiar size.

The aircraft is equipped with 2 underwing hardpoints. They've been split into 2 groups, so you can load rocket pods (stock LAU-32s cover ALL years the aircraft is operational) or a light MG pod or gun (M-60 pod). I've used the basic "baseball cap" pilots, but most military (FAU) crew would most likely have bone domes, without 02 masks. I'd suggest the "usafpilot02", or "usafpilot01", both included.

The American registration numbers seen on the fuselage are 100% correct for C-206s. Taken right from FAA registrations. Like the T-41 (C-172) this is designed to substitute for or replace, the USAF contracts with private flying schools, that keep their civil registry, but are tagged "US Air Force" to show their military usage. The tailfin has USAF serials set for it and they're included. A simple text edit of the decals ini will restore them. You have 18 numbers for both types.

The template can be found inside the main aircraft folder, called "C206_template"

This mod exists pretty much for 'eye candy' to be seen parked at various bases. Although, the cockpit might be a good replacement unit for Veltro's O-2A Skymaster (with a lot of 'moves and removes').

Enjoy!
