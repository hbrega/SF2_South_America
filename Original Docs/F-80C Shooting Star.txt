SF2 Lockheed F-80C/RF-80C/T-33A Shooting Stars Pak by ErikGen			10/3/2012

= For SF2, Full-5 Merged (Reccomended/Preferred) =

This package contains 3 completly new aircraft for SF2. As there are some 1stGen versions available, you'll most likely want to rename or delete the old Pasko versions from your SF2 installs.
*Note: as these aircraft were built with the latest 3W exporter, they will =NOT= work in SF/Wo* 1stGen Installs*

Aircraft included, and skins are:

F-80C:
35th FBS, 8th FBG
36th FBS, 8th FBG
80th FBS, 8th FBG - Korea, 1950/51ish
'Generic' USAF (represents 416th FG circa 1948*)

RF-80C:
45th TRS, Korea

T-33A:
'Generic' USAF
Football City AF (a 'What If' skin for fans of "The Wingman" series*)

While designed with the Korean War in mind, they are easily used in any 'early jet' scenario.
All skins are in DDS format. Decal randomization is set to TRUE for all skins. The 8th FBGs 3 squadrons have 95% historicaly accurate serial numbers. The 416th skin has 'semi-hisorical' serials (meaning they ARE for F-80Cs), and all the nose arts from the original release for Pasko's F-80C. The RF-80 and T-33 have 'generic' serials, but reflect actual aircraft, though no squadron affiliation was discoverable.

Drop tanks for all are 'built in' to the aircraft lod; weapons data inis included, as are the pilot figures and seat. Bombs and rockets are NOT included; they're in the GunnyPak, and the soon-to-be-released KAW Weapons pak.
The canopy for all is controlled via the standard Animations Keystroke (tm), Shift/0

Happy Hunting!



*you all KNOW how much I hate wasting good decals!!! <grin>

=TO INSTALL:

As I always reccomend, unzip the "sf2_kaw_shooting-stars_pak.zip" to a temp folder or your desktop or somewhere else that's easy to find

Then, simply, copy/paste the Objects folder supplied directly =OVER= your existing /Objects folder. The included Objects folder contains the Aircraft, Decals, Weapons and PIlots sub-folders.

Copy/Paste the /Sounds folder directly -OVER- your existing /Sounds folder. 
 
You'll probably be asked "OVERWRITE?", just say Yes for all. 

I've already seperated out the various folders (Aircraft, Decals, etc), so they'll drop right where they're supposed to be.

----------------------------
Notes:
The FM may need futher refinements; remember -- this aircraft IS not a dogfighter when compared to the MiG-15s (both the Fagot-A and most definatley the Fagot-B)
